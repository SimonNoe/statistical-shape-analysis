# Muscle shape analysis and modelling for children with cerebral palsy: a proof-of-concept
This repository was created to contain the functions used in my master's thesis. The functions were used for shape analysis and -modelling of muscles. The input datasets are not included for privacy protection reasons.

The script 'shape_analysis.m' contains the representative shape analysis, the distance analysis and the shape mode analysis. The script 'simulation.m' contains the functionality to perform the same analyses after applying a distortion to the input dataset. Shape modelling was performed using the 'shape_modelling.m' script. 'distfield.m' was a helper function used to calculate the distances between two muscles, while 'Distortion.m' was used to apply distortions to the muscle origins.
