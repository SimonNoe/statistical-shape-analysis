# Muscle shape analysis and modelling for children with cerebral palsy: a proof-of-concept
This repository was created to contain the functions used in my master's thesis. The functions were used for shape analysis and -modelling of muscles. The input datasets are not included for privacy protection reasons.

The script 'shape_analysis.m' contains the representative shape analysis, the distance analysis and the shape mode analysis. The script 'simulation.m' contains the functionality to perform the same analyses after applying a distortion to the input dataset. Shape modelling was performed using the 'shape_modelling.m' script. 'distfield.m' was a helper function used to calculate the distances between two muscles, while 'Distortion.m' was used to apply distortions to the muscle origins. The 'Functions' folder contains toolboxes created by other people, whose functionality was used in the scripts. 'nonrigidICP' was used to perform non-rigid registration, and was obtained [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41396-nonrigidicp). 'Remesher' was used to downsample the 3D models of the muscles, and was obtained [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49691-patch-remesher). 'SSMbuilder' was used to perform the PCA for shape mode analysis, and was obtained [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49940-shape-model-builder). 'plyread' and 'plywrite' were used to read and write the .ply files containing the muscle shapes, and were obtained from [here](https://github.com/markeroon/matlab-computer-vision-routines/tree/master/file_management) and [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55171-plywrite).
